# covid-growth

This is a simple approach to calculate the probability for at least one person in a healthy group (A) to meet one sick person in a second group (B).
  - This model assumes that the population size is steady.
  - This model is considering a steady growth of infection.
  - This model is not considering recovery and mortality rates (e.g. SIR-model).

This model is exclusively used for indication purposes and should not be considered a representation of the actual reality.
